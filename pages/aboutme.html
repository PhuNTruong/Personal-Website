        Phu Truong, The College student
      </summary>
      <p>
        Is a college student majoring in Computer Science at California Polytechnic State University, Pomona.
        It is my 3rd year at CPP. I am an immigrant from Vietnam. I speak English, Vietnamese, and some Spanish.
        I do not know what exactly I want to specialize in, even though I should by now.
